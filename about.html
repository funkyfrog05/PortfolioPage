<h1>About me</h1>
<p>I am a senior in high school and have started learning java and html. I have received my IB diploma.
    Some of my hobbies include singing and volunteer work. I volunteer at 2 nonprofits, with both of their objectives
    being helping the less fortunate. The first nonprofit I am a part of is Food4ThoughtFoundation. I am the development director
    and some of my tasks include, outreach, helping plan and host events, as well as  <p>

<p2>I want to study computer science because I am excited to work with innovative technology to develop solutions to real world problems.
    The problem-solving aspect of computer science is very appealing to me. I would like to create solutions to automate processes ranging 
    from food production to human machine interactions. Last summer, my dad challenged me to automate the grocery shopping process, so I 
    created a program that compiled all the items and prices from different stores into one list. This program automated price comparison 
    of different goods. I hope to use my skills and knowledge to make a significant impact in the world.</p2>
